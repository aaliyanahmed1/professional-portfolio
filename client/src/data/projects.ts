    fullDescription: `
      Sign2Speech is an AI-powered real-time communication tool designed to translate sign language gestures into spoken language. 
      The system enhances accessibility for the hearing-impaired and can be used in healthcare, education, and public services.

      ðŸš€ **Technical Pipeline**:
      - **Gesture Detection**: A YOLO-based custom model trained on sign gestures captures hand signs in real-time.
      - **Semantic Understanding**: Ollama (LLM) interprets the recognized sign's context and translates it to natural language.
      - **Speech Generation**: A Text-to-Speech (TTS) module vocalizes the interpreted response.

      ðŸ”§ Tools Used: YOLO, OpenCV, Ollama, TTS, Python.
